# The Introduction



## The Spaces

- Starbase (hub, can launch from, will eventually outfit here)
- System space (flying around, seeing planets/moons)
- Orbit (viewing a planet, selecting landing sites)
- Planet surface (terrain vehicle)
- Hyperspace (interstellar travel, starmap)
- Derelict interior (this might just be a special "orbit-like" state or a simple interaction screen for MVP)

## The Transitions

- Starbase → System space (launch)
- System space → Orbit (approach planet)
- Orbit → Planet surface (land)
- Planet surface → Orbit (launch)
- Orbit → System space (leave orbit)
- System space → Hyperspace (leave system)
- Hyperspace → System space (enter system)
- System space → Derelict interaction (dock/approach)

## The Interactions

- Scanning (identifying the anomaly, analyzing the derelict)
- Dialogue/message display (derelict logs, artifact discovery, first contact)
- Outfitting screen (buying the mining laser)
- Basic combat (one encounter, can be very simple)
- Crew status (showing injury, doctor treating)

## The Triggers

- Player reaches outer system → prompt or event
- Player approaches anomaly → derelict appears/is scannable
- Player approaches derelict without laser → rebuffed
- Player approaches derelict with laser → combat, then boarding
- Player finds coordinates → ruins location marked
- Player retrieves artifact → Starbase event triggered on return
- Player enters hyperspace → first contact conditions set
