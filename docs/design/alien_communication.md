# Alien Communication
I'm stubbing this out, but we'll need to work out a system that goes over how communication works.

In the original games, alien communication was totally garbled (Communication Skill 0) to fully translated (Communication Skill 250), with intermediate communication training providing partial translations.

For the MVP version of the game, I think just having two versions of a message - an alien version, and an English version - is fine, and then just randomly/procedurally translating words would be fine.

For a fuller experience, I could see an expanded skill system delving into alien specialties that could allow the Comms Officer to "read between the lines" and pick up on nuance, subterfuge, or double-meanings for alien species they were familiar with.

## Original Game
The original game seemed to have worked out a series of syllables for each alien language. 
When interacting with an alien species, these "syllables" were substituted in for chunks of text, depending on the skill of the Communications Officer (CO). 

A CO with zero communication skill would recieve all text with these substituted syllables. As a CO received more training, more recieved text would be "translated" from alien gibberish to understandable English. A CO with a maxed out communication skill of 250 would recieved completely translated communications.

## Syllables
### Starflight 2 Examples
Some examples of alien "gibberish" from Starflight 2:

**ARLA (Friendly)**
[Name Syllables] FLASH STROBE GLOW SHINE FADE FADE PULSE SHINE PULSE FLARE BEAM STROBE BLINK FLASH BLINK GLOW 

**TANDELOU ESHVARA / ESHVEY (Obsequious)**
[Name Syllables] EXPAND DIP CHIRP SWAY SQUISH SHAKE HUMM RATTLE WHINE POP SQUIRT HISS CLICK SHIVER TWIST TURN 

**SPEMIN (Obsequious or Hostile)**
[Name Syllables] BLUNK DURT GOO BEMF ZUG BLEH GHU DENG LUP ZID CHOO BLURT DORT IK BLUK SKREE 

The idea in all these cases is to make the alien "vocabulary" evocative of the alien's communication pattern, rather than any sort of strict adherence to a true syntax.

While there's an urge to fully expand on a language, developing a complete grammar and syntax, the effort will largely be ignored by the player. Aim instead to create as sense of atmosphere for the interaction, and rely on the vibe.

### Beyond the original games
The original games mostly relied on the communications screen to convey a sense of the alien species the player interacted with. This was pretty much the main point of contact with any given alien species. And it was adequate for the stories they were telling.

For this game, we can also leverage a sort of body language and posturing by how we handle alien ship movement and arrangement. Different species will organize their fleets in different, and orient themselves differently when it comes to player interactions and faction standing.

Obviously this goes beyond the minimum viable product approach. But it can help to convey a sense of character that, while largely unseen, can be appreciated subconsciously, and contribute to the atmosphere of an encounter.

## Wishlist system
### Handling Displayed languages
Each alien species could have it's own font to display along with the gibberish, such that translations might have to go through multiple layers of "translations" to fully uncover the full message.

### Changes to the Communications Skill
This game intends to update and expand on that system.
Conventional training would run from 0 to 100. 
At 0, the same untranslated gibberish would show.
At 100, the gibberish would be completely translated.

Each 25 additional points up to 200, could provide additional insights and nuance for a selected "known" species and their language.

At 200, at the cost of 50 points of additional training in a single species (so 250), a CO could be offered a language specialty that would let them pick up on nuances of their culture, subterfuge, and otherwise unlock deep insights that a non-specialist would miss.

A given CO could only have a single language specialty at a given time, so the choice here would need to be deliberate.
