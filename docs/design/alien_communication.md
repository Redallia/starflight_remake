# Alien Communication
I'm stubbing this out, but we'll need to work out a system that goes over how communication works.

In the original games, alien communication was totally garbled (Communication Skill 0) to fully translated (Communication Skill 250), with intermediate communication training providing partial translations.

For the MVP version of the game, I think just having two versions of a message - an alien version, and an English version - is fine, and then just randomly/procedurally translating words would be fine.

For a fuller experience, I could see an expanded skill system delving into alien specialties that could allow the Comms Officer to "read between the lines" and pick up on nuance, subterfuge, or double-meanings for alien species they were familiar with.
