# Space Navigation - Working Document

## Overview
The space navigation system is central to gameplay, providing the primary means of exploration and travel.

## Key Components

### Movement System
#### Grid-Based Movement
- Grid size considerations
- Movement granularity
- Collision boundaries
- Direction handling
- Speed variations

#### Visual Feedback
- Rolling starfield effect
- Movement indicators
- Speed visualization
- Heading display
- Position feedback

### Fuel System
- Consumption rates
- Fuel types
- Emergency reserves
- Refueling mechanics
- Conservation strategies

### Navigation Interface
#### Sector Map
- Scale considerations
- Detail levels
- Navigation markers
- Route planning
- Position tracking

#### System Space
- Star representation
- Planet orbits
- Navigation hazards
- Points of interest
- Traffic/encounters

### Hyperspace Mechanics
- Entry/exit points
- Position persistence
- Travel mechanics
- Hazard system
- Fuel considerations

## Technical Considerations
- Grid system implementation
- Movement calculations
- Collision detection
- Map generation
- State persistence

## Questions to Explore
1. How to handle grid-to-visual translation?
2. What's the optimal grid size?
3. How to implement smooth transitions?
4. What navigation aids are needed?
5. How to handle edge cases?

## Development Priorities
