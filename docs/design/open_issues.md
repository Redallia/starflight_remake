# Open Issues

## Navigation & Coordinate Systems 
We just talked through how hyperspace tiles work, fuel consumption per coordinate, how system space is looser. This deserves its own doc since it's core to the "exploration as gameplay" loop.

## Combat Specification
You've deferred this, but eventually you'll need it. The original's arcade-style combat didn't fit. You mentioned wanting something more tactical. When you're ready, this needs its own doc.

## Alien/Faction Specification
How do aliens work? Disposition, diplomacy, communication patterns, territory. For MVP you just need one alien for first contact, but the system needs thinking through.

## Procedural Generation
How are planets generated? Terrain, resources, life forms, ruins placement. The seeds, the algorithms, the distribution rules.

## Economy & Trade
Credits, pricing, what's valuable, how Starport trade works, how STV modifies prices. Deferred but will need documenting.

## Save System
What gets saved? When? How? What's the data structure?

## Audio/Visual Style Guide
Not code, but aesthetic direction. What does this game look like? What does it sound like?

## Lore
What exactly is the lore of this setting? Alien/Faction specifications matter for how systems get implemented, but what's the story?
