# Game State Specifications

## Overview

The list of different game states. I'll list the different game states first (tagged with MVP for required for a playable game, tagged with Planned for game states to be added once MVP is achieved). 
After the list, I'll go into detail about what role each game state plays, how the game state is entered, how you can leave it, and what entities, if any, are associated with that game state.

### Game State List
1. Main Menu (MVP)
2. Starport (MVP)
3. Space (MVP)
4. In Orbit (MVP)
5. Planet Surface (MVP)
6. Hyperspace (MVP)
7. Communications (MVP)
8. Starmap (MVP)

## Main Menu
The main menu is a standalone screen that allows player to start a new game, load an existing game, or exit the game.

### Planned 

## Starport
Starport is the starting state for new games. It's intended to act as a central hub for player interactions with the in-universe organization the player belongs to.

### Current state
A navigable menu that allows the player to view their ship stats, launch into space, or return to the main menu.

### Planned State
A graphical game screen, navigable by the player with the usual WASD controls. Different doors give player access to different stand-alone screens where they can:
1. Launch into Space
2. Review messages from the organization
3. Fill crew roles
4. Add upgrades to the player ship
5. Purchase equipment and materials not related to the ship
