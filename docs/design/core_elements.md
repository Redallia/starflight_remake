## Questions to Consider for Each Element
1. What made this element fun in the original game?
2. What frustrated players about this element?
3. What modern gaming conventions could improve this element?
4. How does this element interact with other systems?
5. What is the minimum viable implementation of this element?

## Notes
- Each element should maintain the spirit of the original while being open to modern improvements
