# Game Loops

## The Core Fantasy

You are a surveyor on the frontier. Behind you is the known - Starport, civilization, safety. Ahead is the unknown - uncharted stars, alien mysteries, ancient secrets.

Discovery is the reward. Not points, not levels - *knowing things you didn't know before*. Every expedition pushes the boundary of the known a little further. Every return brings back data, artifacts, questions.

The universe is vast and you are small. But you have a ship, a crew, and the will to find out what's out there.

## The Primary Loop

Everything in the game serves one fundamental cycle:

**Frontier → Capability → Deeper Frontier → Revelation**

1. **Frontier:** You're at the edge of what you can reach. Unexplored space stretches before you.

2. **Capability:** You acquire what you need to push further - fuel, equipment, information, diplomatic access.

3. **Deeper Frontier:** With new capability, previously unreachable places open up. You venture in.

4. **Revelation:** You discover something. An artifact. A message. A contact. An answer - or a new question.

The revelation at the end of each cycle is what makes you want to start the next one. Without it, you're just grinding. With it, you're *exploring*.

## The Loop at Every Scale

This same pattern repeats whether you're talking about a single play session or the entire game:

| Scale | Frontier | Capability | Deeper Frontier | Revelation |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Single session** | Nearby planets | Fuel, cargo space | That distant signal | A strange artifact |
| **MVP intro** | Inner system | Mining laser | Derelict, outer system | Hyperspace tech, first contact |
| **Story sector** | Known space | Ship upgrades, crew skills | Restricted regions | Mystery solved, new questions |
| **Full game** | Starting sector | Sector unlocks, faction access | New sectors | The big picture |

The intro scenario isn't just a tutorial - it's the entire game structure compressed into a single arc. If the intro feels right, the game feels right.

## The MVP Introductory Arc

The player's first experience demonstrates the loop in miniature:

1. **Launch with fanfare** - Humanity's first expedition. You're making history.

2. **Inner system (Frontier)** - Rocky planets, safe exploration. Learn to scan, land, explore.

3. **Anomaly detected** - Something in the outer system. A reason to push further.

4. **Derelict ship (Barrier)** - Defended by automated systems. You can't get in.

5. **Return to Starport (Capability)** - Outfit the mining laser. First taste of the upgrade loop.

6. **Back to derelict (Deeper Frontier)** - Fight through defenses. Crew injury introduces the doctor. Retrieve coordinates.

7. **Inner system ruins** - Follow the breadcrumb. Find the artifact.

8. **Return to Starport (Revelation)** - Artifact analyzed. Hyperspace technology unlocked.

9. **Hyperspace (New Frontier)** - The sector opens up. Other stars are reachable.

10. **First contact (Revelation)** - You are not alone. The real game begins.

Each return to Starport has purpose. First time: "I need something." Second time: "I found something." The loop earns its structure.

## Two Modes, Same Loop

The game supports two modes of play. Both use the same fundamental loop; they differ in where revelations come from.

### Story Mode

Revelations are **authored**. Designers placed breadcrumbs for you to follow. The derelict contains coordinates because someone wrote that into the game. The mystery has an answer, and you're meant to find it.

**Characteristics:**
- Hand-crafted mysteries with intentional pacing
- Breadcrumbs lead to specific discoveries
- NPCs provide hints and direction
- Narrative arc with beginning, middle, end
- Satisfying because: the puzzle has a solution

### Sandbox Mode

Revelations are **emergent**. The procedural generation created that derelict. The "story" is what happened to *you* - your navigator died on a frozen moon, you limped home on fumes, you found a signal nobody planned.

**Characteristics:**
- Procedurally generated content
- No predetermined mystery to solve
- Faction interactions generate ongoing threads
- Player creates their own meaning
- Satisfying because: this is *my* story

Both modes coexist. Story sectors have authored content. Sandbox sectors are the endless frontier. The player chooses how much of each they want.

## Supporting Loops

These loops exist to pace the primary loop. They are not ends in themselves.

### Fuel and Range

**Purpose:** Creates tension, limits how far you can push per expedition.

You can't explore forever. Fuel is finite. The question is always: do I have enough to get back? This forces decisions - push further and risk it, or play safe and return?

Range management means expeditions have natural rhythm. You venture out, you reach your comfortable limit, you return. Each upgrade to engines or fuel capacity expands that rhythm.

### Economic Loop

**Purpose:** Funds capability upgrades.

Gather resources (minerals, lifeforms, data) → Sell at Starport → Purchase upgrades → Explore further

The economic loop is the *means*, not the *end*. You're not gathering minerals because minerals are interesting. You're gathering minerals because you want that engine upgrade so you can reach the signal at the edge of the sector.

If the economic loop ever feels like the point, something has gone wrong.

### Crew Development

**Purpose:** Improves effectiveness, creates attachment.

Crew members have skills that affect outcomes. A skilled Science Officer gets better scan results. A skilled Navigator flies more efficiently and shoots more accurately. A skilled Doctor keeps everyone alive.

Training crew at Starport is another form of capability building. But crew also creates emotional stakes - when your engineer dies on a hostile world, it should *matter*.

### Ship Upgrades

**Purpose:** Enables access to new areas and challenges.

Better engines = longer range = more frontier accessible.
Better shields/weapons = survive hostile encounters = access dangerous regions.
Better sensors = find things others miss = more revelations.

Ship upgrades are the most tangible form of capability. "I couldn't go there before. Now I can."

## What This Game Isn't

Maintaining focus requires knowing what you're *not* building.

**Not a combat game.** Combat exists as obstacle and consequence, not as the core activity. You're a survey vessel, not a warship. Fighting should feel like "shit, I have to deal with this" not "time to rack up kills."

**Not a trading sim.** Trade exists to fund exploration. If players are optimizing trade routes for their own sake, the exploration loop has failed to provide sufficient pull.

**Not a 4X.** You're not building an empire, managing populations, or conquering territory. You're one ship, one crew, pushing into the unknown.

**Not a grind.** If players feel like they're grinding, the revelation pacing is off. Every expedition should have the *possibility* of finding something interesting, not just accumulating resources.

## Emotional Rhythm

The loop should create feelings, not just mechanics.

| Phase | Emotion |
|-------|---------|
| **Setting out** | Anticipation, maybe a little anxiety. What's out there? |
| **Exploration** | Wonder, curiosity, loneliness. The void is vast. |
| **Discovery** | Surprise, satisfaction, sometimes unease. What IS this? |
| **Resource pressure** | Tension, calculation. Can I make it back? Should I push further? |
| **Return** | Relief, accomplishment. I made it. I brought something back. |
| **Revelation** | Excitement, motivation. Now I understand. Now I can go further. |

The original Starflight had this rhythm. The loneliness of deep space. The relief of seeing Starport again. The excitement of first contact. This remake should capture that emotional arc.

## Revelation Types

Not all revelations are equal. Variety keeps the loop fresh.

**Capability unlocks** - New technology, ship equipment, crew abilities. "Now I can..."

**Information** - Coordinates, history fragments, alien cultural insights. "Now I know..."

**Access** - Diplomatic relationships, codes, permissions. "Now they'll let me..."

**Questions** - Things that reframe what you thought you knew. "Wait, what?"

**Artifacts** - Items with tangible effects or trade value. "What does this do?"

A healthy revelation diet mixes all of these. Too many capability unlocks feels like a tech tree. Too much information feels like a reading simulator. Too many artifacts and they stop feeling special.

## Failure States

Understanding how the loop can fail helps prevent it.

**System failure:** Capability ceiling reached, but frontier remains. The player has done everything they can afford but can't progress. Grinding with no payoff. ("I need 10,000 more credits but I've scanned everything nearby.")

**Experience failure:** Capability exists, but nothing interesting to find. Exploration without reward. ("I can go anywhere but it's all the same empty planets.")

**Pacing failure:** Revelations come too fast (nothing feels earned) or too slow (boredom, frustration).

**Motivation failure:** The player doesn't care about the mystery. The revelations don't create pull. ("So what if the Ancients existed? Why should I care?")

Good design keeps capability and revelation in tension. You're always *almost* able to reach the next interesting thing.

## Future Systems

These aren't in the MVP but are designed to extend the loop.

### Factions

Factions are revelation *sources*. As you build relationships:
- New information becomes available ("The Velox will tell you about the ruins now")
- New areas open up ("Thrynn space is no longer hostile")
- New quests/threads appear ("We need you to investigate something")

Factions make sandbox mode sustainable. Without them, you'd run out of mysteries. With them, the aliens keep handing you reasons to explore.

### Colonies

Recommended planets become colonies. Colonies become:
- Resource sources (income without grinding)
- Quest sources (colony needs help)
- Emotional stakes (your colony is threatened)

### Expanded Crew

Crew members with personalities, relationships, personal quests. Their stories become part of your story.

### Expanded Ship Types

More ship types will lend themselves naturally to different mysteries being discovered/uncovered. The basic ship is a simple survey ship that can be outfitted with more cargo capacity, better weaponry, armor, and shields as the game demands. But by introducing different ship types, we can tweak and change the ship capacities and introduce:
- cargo ships, if we're developing a trading game loop
- science ships, to perform more targeted/specialized survey types
- military ships, because, let's face it, people are going to want space combat at some point
- captured ships, because sometimes the right answer is to abandon your failing vessel

## Summary

**The game system is about:** Building capability to explore further.

**The game experience is about:** Uncovering mysteries through exploration.

**The player succeeds when:** There's always more frontier to reach, always more mysteries to uncover.

**The game succeeds when:** Each capability gain opens new frontier, each frontier contains new revelations, each revelation motivates the next expedition.
