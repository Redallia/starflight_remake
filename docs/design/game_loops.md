# Game Design - Core Philosophy

The overall vision of this game is that you're a surveyor on the frontier, vast and unknown. Investigation is the order of the day, and discovery is the reward. You might even uncover a mystery or two in the process.

When we're unsure if a mechanic belongs, we ask "does this serve that vision?"

# Two Modes
Story sectors vs sandbox sectors. 
Different flavors of the same core experience. 
Story sectors have a narrative structure and pull - mysteries, breadcrumbs to trace and follow, revelation to be revealed. 
Sandbox sectors have freedom. The map is blank, so fill it in. Go out and see what happens. 
Both share the same fundamental mechanics, but the reward structure differs.
