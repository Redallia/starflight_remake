# Game Design Ideas

## Overview
Drawing inspiration Dwarf Fortress, this document aims to capture short scenes, moments, or vignettes that I want to see happen in the course of playing the game. 
A sort of Story Driven Development, where these short story snippets are what drives the development of in-game systems.

Additionally, I want to capture a sort of wishlist of game elements that I want to see implemented as the game is developed.

**What this isn't**
This is not intended to be an development bible.
This is just a collection of ideas, what ifs, and idle daydreaming for what this project might strive for.
A lot of these ideas feel achievable, but technical or practical limitations might prevent seeing them realized. 

## Design Intent
### Two game modes
I would love for there to be two game modes operating at the same time: 
    - story-mode, with hard coded mysteries and storylines
    - sandbox-mode, with emergent storytelling

The starting "Starport" equivalent for this game would act as a nexus point, giving the player access to different sectors from some central location, and thus allowing both modes to operate side-by-side.

In-game explanations can be provided as for why advanced techology can't transfer between sectors: 
    "Nexus travel using anything other than basic equipment has proven to be impossible"

This would prevent the tendency towards power-creep and provide an incentive for players to want to explore and gather resources.

### Expanded Crew Interactions
The player's crew in the original game had no opportunities to perform actions beyond ship functions.
For this remake, I would be looking for chances for specific crew members to contribute beyond their role on the ship.

**Navigators**
Navigators could provide in-game hints and knowledge about learned constellations or named planets by identifying/labelling them on the sector map.

**Engineers**
Aliens in distress could send out calls for help. On arrival, the engineer crew member could enter their ship and assist with/coordinate repairs.

Planetary ruins might have opportunities for well-trained engineers to unlock otherwise unavailable messages, secrets, or artifacts.

**Communications**
Beyond simply translating or ship-to-ship interactions, Communications could be expanded into diplomacy or cultural understanding, offering stance suggestions or communication insights to the player during alien interactions.

Planetary ruins might have texts that would become decipherable to well-trained communications officers. 

**Doctors**
A distress call from another starship could request medical assistance. A well-trained doctor could faciliate that assistance.

## Wishlist

### Star Systems
**Inner/Outer orbits**
Star systems differentiate between outer and inner planetary orbits. The player could enter a star system, and see the outer planets in orbit, while the inner planets would act like a separate enterable system.
This could provide a further sense of depth and distance and increase the sense of space players felt.

**Gas Giants**
Gas giants themselves could act as their own enterable system. The gas giant would take the place of the star, while its moons would be the giant's "planets". Any planet with a moon could be handled in this way.

### New locations
The original games had a small number of special story-related locations. 
Starflight seemed to only have had planet-based locations. 
Starflight 2 included unique ship-based encounters like Gorzek, the abandoned Leghk ship, and the Uhl. 
Both games had a just a single space station that the player count interact with: Starport.

For my remake, I'd like to expand the number of locations as well as more varied opportunities for interacting with them.
The trade-off is that with more locations like this, there's less telegraphing to the player this "THIS IS IMPORTANT! PAY ATTENTION!". 
This might necessitate making story-relevant locations or events more obvious.

**Location-based Scenarios**
Different locations could provide miniature scenarios requiring different crew member skills to accomplish and/or fully explore.

    - Derelict ships could require scanning (Science Officer), repairs (Engineer), translation of logs (Navigator, Communications), forensics (Doctor).
    - Ruins could require in-orbit locating and scanning (Science Officer), gaining access (Engineer), translation services

Locations could utilize an expanded side-scroller game interface, allowing player to play in a simple "away team" game loop.

Location-based scenarios would also help to break up the repetitive gameplay loops present in the regular game, and provide a more varied and improved visual experience.

### Including modern gameplay loops
**Colony building**
In the original games, the player could find and recommend habitable planets for colonization. But beyond simply logging them and receiving a monetary reward, these had no other effect on gameplay, and were utilized as quick way to accumulate credits for ship improvement.

In the new game, as the player finds and recommends planets for colonization, these recommendations could be the source for further gameplay in the form of:
    - finding good colonization sites on the recommended planet
    - escorting colony ships to the site
    - providing colony resources and materials through trade
    - giving players investment opportunities and returns in the form of making resources available, providing a return on invested credits
    - colony growth could be directed by the player. Specialized buildings, unique structures
    - colonies could require defending, whether from native creatures, raiding bandits, or invading aliens

This obviously represents a radical departure from the original game designs, which were focused on exploration, mystery uncovering, and storytelling. As such, this sort of interaction would be more appropriate for a sandbox-mode sector, rather than a story focused one.

**Sidescroller game**
The original Starflight games had simple interfaces that allowed the player to walk around as a character, instead of flying around in a starship. 
The only place this sort of interaction showed up was in the Starport area.
I would love to see that system expanded into something more.
Explorable ruins, explorable space stations or derelict starships. More and varied options for interacting with the game world.
Locations might have events or interactable objects that might require crews to coordinate efforts:
    - Science Officers could scan environments
    - Engineers could repair broken equipment
    - Communicaton Officers could translate ancient or alien languages. 
    - Navigators could interpret location coordinates
    - Doctors could interact with injured individuals in locations, or handle interactions with other living beings/creatures

The aim would be to give the player more options for interaction that felt interesting, and provide more usefulness for crew members beyond their ship roles. Doctors and Engineers especially felt almost superfluous in the original game outside of specific conditions.

### Factions


## Stories
Each story is intended to act as the sort of event that could come about as the result of emergent gameplay. 
The idea is not to code specific stories into the game, but to allow certain stories to happen naturally as the result of game systems interacting.
Obviously, this is something that goes well beyond the intent and purpose of the original games, which had hard coded storylines and mysteries that the player would uncover.

**TO BE POPULATED AS THE STORIES COME TO ME**
