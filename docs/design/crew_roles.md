# Core Crew Roles
The player's ship has six core crew roles, and each role performs a different function on the ship.

# Expanded Roles - Wishlist
While this is nominally a remake of the original Starflight games, the intent is to take the what was present in the original games and expand on it.
That might include deepening the options available to the different crew roles, or adding entirely new roles for specialized purposes.
